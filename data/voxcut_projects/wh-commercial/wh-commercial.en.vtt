00:00:00.033 --> 00:00:03.403
The President: The more than 
a broken system tells you

00:00:03.403 --> 00:00:06.873
that you're wrong, the more 
certain you should be

00:00:06.873 --> 00:00:10.977
that you must keep pushing ahead.

00:00:10.977 --> 00:00:14.314
Because it's the outsiders 
who change the world

00:00:14.314 --> 00:00:17.217
and who make a real and 
lasting difference.

00:00:17.217 --> 00:00:21.955
Nothing worth doing 
ever came easy.

00:00:21.955 --> 00:00:28.294
Treat the word impossible as 
nothing more than motivation.

00:00:28.294 --> 00:00:31.398
The future belongs to 
the people who follow

00:00:31.398 --> 00:00:34.868
their heart, no matter 
what the critics say.

00:00:34.868 --> 00:00:39.005
We must always remember 
that we share one home

00:00:39.005 --> 00:00:42.475
and one glorious destiny.

00:00:42.475 --> 00:00:47.247
We all bleed the same 
red blood of patriots.

00:00:47.247 --> 00:00:51.684
We all salute the same 
great American flag.

00:00:51.684 --> 00:00:55.488
Our best days 
are yet to come.
