1
00:00:00,033 --> 00:00:03,403
The President: The more than 
a broken system tells you

2
00:00:03,403 --> 00:00:06,873
that you're wrong, the more 
certain you should be

3
00:00:06,873 --> 00:00:10,977
that you must keep pushing ahead.

4
00:00:10,977 --> 00:00:14,314
Because it's the outsiders 
who change the world

5
00:00:14,314 --> 00:00:17,217
and who make a real and 
lasting difference.

6
00:00:17,217 --> 00:00:21,955
Nothing worth doing 
ever came easy.

7
00:00:21,955 --> 00:00:28,294
Treat the word impossible as 
nothing more than motivation.

8
00:00:28,294 --> 00:00:31,398
The future belongs to 
the people who follow

9
00:00:31,398 --> 00:00:34,868
their heart, no matter 
what the critics say.

10
00:00:34,868 --> 00:00:39,005
We must always remember 
that we share one home

11
00:00:39,005 --> 00:00:42,475
and one glorious destiny.

12
00:00:42,475 --> 00:00:47,247
We all bleed the same 
red blood of patriots.

13
00:00:47,247 --> 00:00:51,684
We all salute the same 
great American flag.

14
00:00:51,684 --> 00:00:55,488
Our best days 
are yet to come.
